If you'd like to manually run event gathering, you can do so from within the Actions tab of your repo -> Event Gather -> Run workflow.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are some optional configurations for the data gathering pipeline which can be added to `python/event-gather-config.json`. No action is needed for a barebones pipeline run, but the optional parameters can be checked in the [CDP pipeline config documentation](https://councildataproject.org/cdp-backend/cdp_backend.pipeline.html#module-cdp_backend.pipeline.pipeline_config). Note that `google_credentials_file` and `get_events_function_path` should not be modified and will populate automatically if you have followed the steps above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to review the [CDP Ingestion Model documentation](https://councildataproject.github.io/cdp-backend/ingestion_models.html) for the object definition to return from your `get_events` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your function is complete and pushed to the `main` branch, feel free to delete this setup directory.\n",
